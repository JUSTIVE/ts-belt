### How to run benchmarks?

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mobily/ts-belt.git
```

Install all dependencies and build `ts-belt`:

```bash
yarn
yarn build dist -t
```

Go to the `benchmarks` directory and install all dependencies as well:

```bash
cd ./benchmarks
yarn
```

Then, run the following command in order to run benchmark suites:

```bash
yarn start
# or
yarn generate # if you want to generate a markdown file
```

:::info

Both commands generate a new results file, which is saved in the `benchmarks/.results` directory. Don't hesitate to send the results file to me! ðŸ˜Š (DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/__marcin_) to get more details)
